# Post-choice Bias


This folder contains the code to run all model-free and model-based analyses. 

Note:
Our model-based analyses use likelihood optimisation to find the appropriate parameters. Even though this method generally gives a unique solution which is ideally the global maximum, we recommend using multiple starting points (20-25 would be sufficient) to make sure the optimisation algorithm finds the global maximum.
