# Post-choice Bias
Repository for post-decision confirmation bias paper.
If you use the data or the code, please cite Talluri, Urai et al. 2018.

The repository is organized into the following folders:
1. Perceptual_Experiment: Code to run the perceptual experiment. This code uses Psychtoolbox-3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) on MATLAB.
2. Data: Contains raw data from both perceptual and cognitive tasks. The data for cognitive task was obtained from Bronfman et al. 2015 (https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.40f6v). The folder also contains analysis-ready data files that are called by the analysis scripts, to replicate the figures and results in the paper. In addition, matlab scripts that give the analysis-ready data files from the raw data files are also provided in the folder. All data files are in csv format.
3. Code: Contains all analysis scripts to replicate the figures and other results in the paper.

Note: All the scripts have been commented for readers to understand and any functions used in these scripts that are not built-in have been added. However, please understand that the description may not be complete and if you run into any issues while running the code please contact Bharath Chandra Talluri (bharathchandra.talluri@gmail.com) or Anne Urai (anne.urai@gmail.com).
